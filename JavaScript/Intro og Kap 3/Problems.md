# Coding challenges

### 1. Palindrome Checker: Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.


### 2. FizzBuzz: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".


### 3. Factorial: Write a function that calculates the factorial of a number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.


### 4. Fibonacci Sequence: Write a function that generates the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.


### 5. Array Flattening: Write a function that takes a nested array and flattens it into a single array.
